# RGB-COLOR-SENSING-ROBOT | Arduino IDE, Arduino Nano, Embedded C

Introduction:-

This project focuses on developing an RGB color detector using an Arduino microcontroller and the TCS3200 color sensor. The system is designed to detect and measure the frequency of RGB colors, with results displayed on an LCD panel. The Arduino processes the color sensor data, converting RGB frequency combinations into specific color outputs. The setup is fully self-contained, using integrated circuits (ICs) and photodiodes for accurate color detection. Additionally, this project can be extended into an autonomous RGB color-sensing robot, where the robot reacts and navigates based on detected colors. The setup also includes PWM control, I2C communication, and can be interfaced with various software tools for further color analysis.
